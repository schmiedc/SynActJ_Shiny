# SynActJ Shiny App

Synaptic Activity in ImageJ (SynActJ) is an image and data analysis workflow that allows to analyze synaptic activity. It is based on a Fiji plugin and a R Shiny App that implement the automated image analysis of active synapses in time-lapse movies. We tested the workflow with movies of pHluorin or calcium sensors.

SynActJ Shiny performs the data analysis for the data generated by the SynActJ Fiji plugin:<br/>

The R data processing and plotting is implemented as [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) App. This allows you to read in the output data and execute the data processing using a graphical interface.
Overview plots as well as detail plots are shown in the SynActJ Shiny App directly for user convenience.
